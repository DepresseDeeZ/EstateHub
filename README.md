# EstateHub

Welcome to **EstateHub**! This project aims to create a dynamic and user-friendly online platform for property listings and transactions. EstateHub is designed to cater to real estate agents, property sellers, and potential buyers or renters, providing an intuitive interface for seamless interaction.


## Step-by-Step Development

### 1. **Project Setup**
- Initialized the project with separate directories for frontend (`React.js`) and backend (`Node.js`).
- Created a GitHub repository to manage version control.

---

### 2. **Frontend Development**
- Bootstrapped with `create-react-app`.
- Installed required libraries: `react-router-dom`, `axios`, `tailwindcss`, `formik`, `yup`, `leaflet`, etc.
- Configured Tailwind CSS for responsive styling.
- Created key components:
  - **Reusable Components**: `Navbar`, `Footer`, `SearchBar`, and `PropertyCard`.
  - **Pages**: `Home`, `Listing`, `Agent Profiles`, and `Property Details`.
- Integrated Leaflet for interactive maps to display property locations.

---

### 3. **Backend Development**
- Built with `Node.js` and `Express.js`.
- Set up MongoDB as the database using `Mongoose`.
- Created schemas for users, properties, agents, and reviews.
- Developed RESTful APIs for user authentication (JWT), property management, and agent profiles.
- Used `Socket.io` to implement real-time chat functionality.

---

### 4. **Features Added**
- **Advanced Search Filters**: Filter properties by location, price, type, and amenities.
- **Interactive Maps**: Integrated with Leaflet for detailed property views.
- **Image Management**: Used Cloudinary to manage and optimize media uploads.
- **User Authentication**: Secured with JWT and validated forms using `Formik` and `Yup`.

---

### 5. **Deployment**
- Deployed the frontend on **Vercel**.
- Deployed the backend on **Heroku**, integrating MongoDB and configuring environment variables.

---

### 6. **Testing and Optimization**
- Tested APIs with **Postman** and ensured smooth integration with the frontend.
- Optimized performance:
  - Lazy loading for images.
  - Efficient database queries using Prisma.
- Ensured responsiveness across devices using Tailwind CSS.

---
